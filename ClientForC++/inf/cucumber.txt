Cucumbers should be watered daily in small amounts
doses Soil moisture during the growth period letter
machine is recommended to maintain on levels of 
70-80% HB, and during the flowering period - 
55-60% HB (under such conditions, the process is 
more successful fertilization). Lack of moisture 
stops the growth of plants, contributes to the 
appearance of bitterness in fruits. Watering 
cucumbers is desirable take daily in small doses. 
To the beginning flowering plants are watered 
moderately - 2-3 l / m2, warm water (24-26*C). 
During flowering and fruiting the rate of irrigation
is increased, proving in time fruiting up to 6-7 
l / m2 (taking into account the coefficient 
evaporation rate). Cucumber plants it is recommended
to water with impure water, because nutrients 
(especially nitrogen) quickly are washed into the 
lower horizons, and plants feel a deficiency, and 
water with dissolved in it mineral fertilizers with 
trace elements chelated form.
