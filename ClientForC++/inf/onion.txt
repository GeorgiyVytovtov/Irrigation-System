Onions are one of the most demanding crops water 
supply, especially in the first 3-4 weeks after 
germination, when a change occurs in the plants
of the root system and the first real one appears
leaf. Insufficient amount of moisture causes strong 
thinning of crops. Therefore, immediately after 
sowing and installation of SKZ includes watering 
until full wetting of the humidification circuit in 
the area of occurrence seeds. Soil moisture in the 
main placement zone root mass must be maintained 
before the beginning the formation of bulbs is not
lower than 80%, in the period the formation of bulbs
 - not lower than 70% of the HB. Maintenance of soil
moisture in the area of occurrence root system of 
cultivated plants in there is an optimal level for 
this phase of development the main principle of drip 
irrigation. Irrigation norms, and therefore the 
watering regime, are determined by the amount of 
evaporated and moisture consumed by plants and 
adjusted for of each plot in particular. Irrigation is
stopped approximately 20 days before harvesting. 
During ripening gradually reduces soil moisture, which 
has a positive effect on the viability of the bulbs and
prevents their damage by gray and cervical rotting
